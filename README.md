Graceful Degradation of milforded.org site for Small screens and tablets and phones

Also, see withing the repository a small PowerPoint presentation with changes.

I maintained most of the features and colors, used some of the original code and wrote some of my own. Changes you will see include:
•	When the site is looked at in a minimized screen or smaller screen, the navigation, picture indicators, and gallery buttons do not fall out of the containers. 
•	I have also optimized the sites space for smaller screens by moving, or in one case removing, some features for smaller sized screens while still maintaining the look and feel of the site you have built.
